/**
 @brief OZZipFile provides read or write access to a single zip file.
 <p> During initialization you must specify the access mode, i.e. if the zip
 file is being created, appended, or unzipped. You can also specify if the zip 
 file must be opened in legacy 32-bit mode, to be compatible with older 
 operating systems (such as some versions of Android).</p>
 <p> If the zip file has been opened in unzip mode, you can list its content,
 move within its content from file to file, and finally open a reading stream 
 of the selected file.</p>
 <p> If the zip file has been opened in creation or append mode, you can open a 
 writing stream to add new files to its content.</p>
